# World_Weather_Analysis

## Overview of Project:
In this challenge, we used our knowledge of the Pandas library and APIs to create a vacation plan by first taking a user input for preferred weather temperature, filter all the cities according to the preferances, and identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. We then chose four cities using the beta tester from the list of travel destinations. Finally, using the Google Maps Directions API, we created a travel route between the four cities and created a marker layer map.

## Results:
### When we filtered cities according to the user's weather temperature preferences, we got the following DataFrame:
![filtered_cities](https://github.com/KJoshi111/World_Weather_Analysis/blob/main/filtered_cities.png)

### When we chose four cities using the beta tester, we got the following map:
![chosen_cities](https://github.com/KJoshi111/World_Weather_Analysis/blob/main/Vacation_Itinerary/WeatherPy_travel_map_markers.png)

### When we created a travel route, we got the following map:
